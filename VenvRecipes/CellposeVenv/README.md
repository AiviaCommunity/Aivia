# Cellpose For Aivia

## Cellpose Information

This Aivia python recipe applies the Cellpose deep learning model to generate segmentation for cells/nucleus in 2D or 3D images.

Online information about Cellpose are listed below:

* Cellpose Website: http://www.cellpose.org/
* Cellpose GitHub: https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose
* Cellpose documentation: http://www.cellpose.org/static/docs/index.html
* Cellpose paper: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.02.931238v1

## Requirements

* Vuitual Environment for Cellpose - the required virtual environment will be created automatically when you run Cellpose_Aivia.py for the first time. All required python packages will be installed in this virtual environment. You can check the `requirements.txt` to see what packages will be installed.

* Python 3.6+ - comes with Aivia

## Installation

1. Download the whole `CellposeVenv` folder. Since GitHub does not support subfolder download, we zipped the folder here for you: [CellposeVenv.zip](../ZippedVenvFolders/CellposeVenv.zip).

2. Unzip the the downloaded folder `CellposeVenv`. The tree structure of the folder is as follow

```bash=
  CellposeVenv
  ├───CellposeForAivia.py
  ├───requirements.txt
  ├───README.md
  └───Data
      └───Cellpose_venv.py
```

## Execution

1. Load `CellposeForAivia.py` onto Aivia by "File>Open" or drag-and-drop

2. Load a target image onto Aivia

3. In Aivia analysis tools, adjust input, output, and processing parameters.

4. Click on "Start" button and wait for the result
    1. Please make sure that you have the Internet connection and wait longer for the first execution. When you run the recipe for the first time, the required virtual environment, `env`, will be created under `Cellpose_venv`. Python packages used by Cellpose will be downloaded and installed in the enironment.

## Parameters

* Deep Learning Model : acmodel
  * You can select an Aivia's built-in acmodel here for preprocessing. Please leave it as "None" if you only want to use Cellpose.

* Input Image : Aivia channel
  * Input channel to segment.

* Diameter (px) : double
  * Approximate size of the structures you wish to segment (in pixels), **must greater than zero**.

* Model Type (0=cyto, 1=nuc) : int (bool)
  * Boolean to determine which Cellpose model you wish to run.
    * 0 : Choose the cytoplasm model (segment the whole cell).
    * 1 : Choose the nuclei model

* [Cell Probability Threshold](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html?highlight=threshold#cell-probability-threshold) : double, default is 0.0, range from -6.0 to 6.0

    The pixels greater than the Cell Probability(confidence) are used to
    run dynamics and determine masks. The threshold is calculated using a
    Sigmoid function centered at zero (1 / (1 + e^-x)). So the value is
    around -6.0 to 6.0. Decrease this threshold will return more cell masks.

* [Flow Threshold](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html?highlight=threshold#flow-threshold) : double, suggested default is 0.4

    The Flow Threshold is the maximum allowed error of the flows for each mask.
    Increase this threshold if cellpose is not returning as many masks as
    expected.

## Returns

* Mask : Aivia channel
  * The labeled segmentation mask generated by applying the Cellpose model.
* Confidence Map : Aivia channel
  * The XY flow (for 2D) or Z flow (for 3D) generated by applying the Cellpose model. It represents the confidence that each voxel belongs to the segmentation mask.
